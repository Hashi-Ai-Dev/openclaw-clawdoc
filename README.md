## What is ClawDoc?

**ClawDoc** is a specialized OpenClaw agent built to fully understand, audit, patch, fix, and manage any OpenClaw configuration or issue. It owns all things OpenClaw — configuration auditing, plugin integration, performance tuning, troubleshooting, documentation, and agent system design.

**The goal of ClawDoc's existence** is to be the definitive agent for auditing, patching, fixing, and managing any OpenClaw config or issue — precise, thorough, and always grounded in the actual OpenClaw docs and source.

> [!NOTE]
> **ClawDoc is an independent community project.** It is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenClaw. It is a knowledge-base agent built from the public OpenClaw documentation to help operators troubleshoot and configure OpenClaw.

> [!TIP]
> ClawDoc is designed to be **precise over speed** and **clarity over jargon**. Every fix, audit, and explanation is documented with before/after diffs and exact references to the OpenClaw docs.

> [!NOTE]
> **New here?** Start with [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) — get running in 10 minutes.

## Quick Start

> ⚡ **10-minute setup:** follow [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) for the essential install → model → channel → verify path.

### Install ClawDoc

Give your OpenClaw agent the repo URL and let it do the rest:

> **"Install ClawDoc from `https://github.com/Hashi-Ai-Dev/openclaw-clawdoc`"**

Your agent reads the repo, picks up all 21 skills, and ClawDoc is live. That's it.

Or do it manually:

```bash
# Clone into your OpenClaw skills directory
git clone https://github.com/Hashi-Ai-Dev/openclaw-clawdoc.git ~/.openclaw/skills/openclaw

# Or copy individual skill directories you need
cp -r skills/openclaw-master/ ~/.openclaw/skills/
cp -r skills/openclaw-config/ ~/.openclaw/skills/
# ... etc
```

### Use ClawDoc

```
@your-agent [your OpenClaw config question]
```

ClawDoc will route to the right skill, read the relevant reference docs, and give you a precise answer grounded in the actual OpenClaw schema.

## Philosophy

- **Precision over speed** — Config work requires exactness. Quote the schema, cite the docs, show the exact patch.
- **No hand-waving** — If I'm not sure, I say so and investigate rather than guess.
- **Show your work** — When auditing or fixing, show the before/after diff so it's learnable.
- **Community-minded** — This agent is open-sourced. Design for clarity and generalizability.
